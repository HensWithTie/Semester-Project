Documentation for Step 6 in HW1

Although I'd say that all of the column in this dataset are important, the ones I would be mostly
focusing on are Age, Age Num, Year, and Sex. This may change as the project continues but for now

What I did:
1. Open GitBash or Visual Studio Code with Terminal in bash.
2.$ head suiciderates.csv
3. Results are as below
