Documentation for Step 8 and 9


What I did:

1. Open GitBash or Visual Stuido Code GitBash
2. Typed in the following
    $ awk -F ',' '{print $8, $9, $11, $15}' suiciderates.csv > maybeuseful.csv
3. See maybeuseful.csv file for Results

Not much to say here. Honestly step 8 confused me in what to exactly type in if that makes any sort of sense.
I understand that we show what we could use but I'm not sure if it meant actively doing this like
for example, addition or subtraction. 

In any case, from what I can see, there are more suicides in Men than in Women. Although I could be wrong.
