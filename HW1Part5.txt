Concerning using curl for Part 1 HW on Step 5.

I tried doing what step 5 said, which is to use curl, for me it wasn't displaying the actual data set.
Instead it gave me some random information that didn't really matter to me.

What I had to do:

1. Download the csv and manually add it into the local repo
2. git add .
3. git status
4. git commit -m "Added suiciderates.csv"
5. git status 
6. git push
7. Go in and check if it is working.

Why can't technology work as intended. D:
