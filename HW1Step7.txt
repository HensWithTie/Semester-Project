Documentation for HW1 Step 7. 

Honestly I have no clue how this is gonna work.

What I did:
 
 1. Open GitBash or Visual Studio Code GitBash
 2. Typed the following in
    $ awk -F ',' '{print $2 ,$3, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $11}' suiciderates.csv > testfile.csv
 3.See for testfile.csv for result

Honestly I have no idea how the years are in $11 even though in the data set, it is directly in the middle.
This means that the year should NOT technically be in $11.
