After cleaning the data and creating graphs to prove or disprove my hypothesis, 
the suiciderates.csv file states that men have a higher suicide rate than women.
More specifcally, ages 20-24 and 25-34 have the highest suicide rate. In terms of which race has more suicides,
interestingly enough, are American Indians and Alaska Natives. For some reason, they have the highest suicide rate 
out of Whites, Blacks, and Asians.
